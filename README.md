# Personal Learnings

* How to create  and echo custom field suites to give the client a dynamic experience and the ability to be able to change the content, without disrupting the theme.

* Using Sass to nest CSS delarations within one another.

* I learned about how there are two kinds of hooks, action hooks, which are triggered when a certian wordpress resource loads and allow us to call functions at specific times. And then there are filter hooks, that 'hook into' a Word Press event and takes data before its displayed and changes the output

* Taxonomies are metadata that give information about content and can be used to organize content

* Using the default loop to generate dynamic content and understanding to not edit it, but if I'd want more specific outputs from the loop, to use the wp_query loop or the get_posts() loop.

* Using pre_get_posts to organize data , and feed in specific arguments came in handy and learning how to feed in a specific array of arguments to receive a certain outcome.

* Understanding the structure of wordpress and how they get parts using the get_ method , like get_header or get_footer, and made it really easy to remove or add the sidebar on certain pages.

* I learned and used alot of permalinks through out this project, using it made it easy to dynamically link the full page post with any button or excerpt.

* Learning how to manage through someone else's code was really fun and a great skill I learnt, because in the real world it is going to be like this and I'll need to know how to navigate through other peoples code.

* The template hierarchy was a perfect visual to see how Word Press prioritizes pages and gave me a good grasp on which pages to use for which content.

* Exploring the back end of Word Press was really interesting, I realized how easy it is to storeand manipulate data using a CMS.

* I found that specificity was another big point here, and overriding the styles I was given, with a higher amount of specificity.

* I learned how to target certain pages while keeping other undisrupted by using specificity and targeting the page and working my way down to the targeted element.

* Creating custom post types to categorize products and using that custom post type to loop through and echo out specific data
